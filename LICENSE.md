# Commons Clause FAQ Supplement for Sage Bionetworks Software

## I’d like to run my own instance of all or part of the Software at my institution / company rather than use Sage’s hosted service. Is this permitted?

Yes, this is permitted if you are providing the Software or derivative work of the Software to your own institution / company. This is true regardless of whether you are part of a for-profit or not-for-profit organization. You may not, however, charge 3rd parties fees or other forms of consideration for use of a hosted service you provide that is based on the Software without a separate commercial license from us. This includes accepting payment from one party to provide a service to a different party (e.g. accepting a NIH grant to provide a service to other institutions).

## I’d like to use the Software to support a research project at my university / company, and I’d like to modify Software source code to make custom changes for my project. Is this use permitted?

Yes, absolutely. The License makes source code available and authorizes modifications, and the Commons Clause does not change that fact. Sage encourages experimentation with software changes when needed to advance research interests. Furthermore, those modifications belong to you, not Sage.

If you do make improvements to the code base, we would appreciate contribution back to Sage’s main line of development  under the BSD 3-clause license, which benefits the broader community (in the same way that the contributions from others before you benefit you) and may also help make them more maintainable by Sage in the future. But, this is not required by the License.

## What if I need to contract with a developer or development team to make these changes to the Software on my behalf, or to operate a hosted service for my organization - is this use still permitted?

Yes. As long as the developer was modifying the source code to the Software or building a hosted service using the Software on behalf and under the License of a research program at a single institution, we’d consider that use of the Software source code by that institution. It doesn’t matter if the people working with the code are employed by the institution / company or hired to perform this work on a contract basis by the institution /company, as long as the developments are used only by the institution.

## I’d like to offer multiple universities, institutions, or other entities a product or service that would incorporate all or part of the Software. How is that possible?

Sage is interested in partnering with other organizations to increase the impact and use of Sage’s tools. We have applied the Commons Clause to the License  to ensure that Sage is part of the discussion, protecting our continued investment in the Software, and advancing Sage’s mission to serve all researchers regardless of the financial strength of their organization.

## Do all the measures hosted on the platform have the same license terms?

No. Measures have been developed for use on the platform by various parties, and are subject to the licensing and terms of use chosen by their developers.
