    description: |
        Return all the registrations for this user. There may be more than one, if a user installs 
        the application on different devices. It is possible there may be multiple registrations on 
        one device, but Bridge attempts to prevent this.

    operationId: createNotificationRegistration
    summary: Register a client to receive push notifications
    description: |
        Create a new registration. The client will retrieve an identifying token (the exact format and 
        name for the token varies by platform), and register it with Bridge. Bridge will return a 
        Bridge-specific GUID to track this registration, which the client can use to update or delete 
        the registration at a later time. If the token already exists in an existing registration record, 
        then that registration record will be returned in lieu of creating a redundant record.
