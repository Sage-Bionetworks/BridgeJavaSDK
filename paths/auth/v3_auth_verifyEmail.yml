        This API will not normally be called directly by a client. A user will receive an email 
        triggered by the /signUp call, with an URL to open up a page that verifies the email was 
        received at the provided email address. This page is on the Bridge server. That page submits 
        a one-time session token ("sptoken") to this endpoint, in order to change the password. The 
        template for this verification email can be configured as part of a Study through the management 
        APIs.
