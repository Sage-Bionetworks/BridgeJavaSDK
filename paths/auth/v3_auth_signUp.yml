        Depending on the configuration of the study, the user will normally be sent an email with a link 
        to verify his or her email address before the account will be activated. If the user account 
        does not exist, this method will still return 200 in order to prevent "account enumeration" 
        security breaches.

        Only basic credentials are necessary to sign up (email, password and study), but all the 
        information that can be provided for a participant's account can be submitted as part of sign up.
