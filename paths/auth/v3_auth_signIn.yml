        Send user credentials to authenticate with the Bridge server. Whether the server returns 
        200 (user successfully authenticated) or 412 (user has authenticated but has not yet 
        consented to participate in research), the response will contain a user session. 
        
        The session contains the "sessionToken" property with the token that must be used to interact 
        with other endpoints of the service. That value should be sent via the request header 
        "Bridge-Session" to any endpoint requiring authentication. The Bridge session token is 
        currently valid for 12 hours. However, your client application should be prepared to 
        re-authenticate on any call if it returns 401 ("Not authenticated"), as the session may 
        expire before this period for unforeseen reasons, like a server failure.

        If the user has not yet consented, the session also contains detailed information about the 
        consent (or consents) the user must submit a signature for, before they will be allowed to 
        make further calls to Bridge. You can also implement logic to re-consent to updated consents, 
        if desired.
