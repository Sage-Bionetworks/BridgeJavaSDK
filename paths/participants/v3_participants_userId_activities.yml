    summary: Get paged history of activities scheduled for a participant
    description: |
        Provides a view of all the activities that have been created for a participant. The state of these activities is 
        returned without modification. No filtering is performed on the list of activities, which may have been assigned 
        due to different or changing filtering criteria. These records help to determine if a participant is currently active 
        in the study (e.g. if there are no activities, the user has never asked for them them). Records are sorted first 
        by the type of activity, and then by the date the activity was scheduled to start on.

    summary: Delete all activities for a participant

        Intended for use in development. Developers may wish to delete an account's scheduled activities in order 
        to see the impact of changes to schedules for a study. Otherwise, activities from the original 
        scheduling will persist until they expire, alongside tasks issued for the newly changed schedule. **This 
        should not be called on production accounts.**
