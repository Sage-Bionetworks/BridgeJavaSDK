    summary: Withdraw the participant from the study entirely
    description: |
        This endpoint will withdraw the user from any and all signed consents in the study, and 
        set their sharing status to "no_sharing". The user is withdrawn from all subpopulations 
        in the study whether they currently apply to the user or not. Unless you have more 
        complicated consent requirements (like an optional consent that can be signed or not), 
        this is the best approach to withdrawing a user from a study.
