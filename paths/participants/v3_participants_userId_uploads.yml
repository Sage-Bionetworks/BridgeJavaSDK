        Retrieve information about the uploads from a user. This is particularly useful during 
        development to verify the mobile application is sending valid data back to the Bridge 
        server. The API can retrieve up to 2 days worth of upload records, defined by the 
        startTime and endTime timestamps (ISO 8601 format). startTime/endTime are optional and 
        will default to the last 24 hours of uploads. if the endTime is not provided, it will 
        be one day after the startTime. If the startTime is not provided, it will be one day 
        before the endTime.
