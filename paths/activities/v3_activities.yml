        Gets all available, started, or scheduled activities for a user. Once an activity is 
        finished, or expires (the time has passed for it to be started), it will be removed 
        from the list of activities returned to the user.
    parameters:
        - name: offset
          in: query
          description: |
                The user's time zone offset (e.g. +07:00). Scheduled activities will be 
                returned in the timezone submitted at the time of the request.

                Retrieve activities that are scheduled in the future for the indicated number 
                of days past today.

                 Force a look-ahead on repeating activities until at least the indicated number 
                 of activities are scheduled (this is applied to the each schedule in the system 
                 that applies to this user). The system will then return either the activities 
                 for N days, or the minimum number of activities, whichever is the greatest in 
                 number. This setting can help to expose infrequent tasks (weekly, monthly, 
                 etc.) to users.
