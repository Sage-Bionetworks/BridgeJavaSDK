properties:
    appId:
        type: string
        description: |
            App ID that this table row is part of. This never needs to be specified as part of the request and is
            automatically determined by the server.

    studyId:
        type: string
        description: |

    recordId:
        type: string
        description: |
            Record ID represented by this table row. This is unique within a study, but a record may be exported to

        description: Assessment that this upload represents. This is required.
    createdOn:
        type: string

        description: |
            When this upload was created. This is determined by the assessment-specific "summarize" method in the
            Worker. If not specified, the server will automatically set this to the current time.
    testData:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: Whether this upload is test data. If not specified, defaults to false.
    healthCode:

    participantVersion:
        type: integer

            Participant version of the user who uploaded this row. This might not be present if the participant version
            was never created, eg legacy participants.

        additionalProperties:
            type: string
        description: |
            Metadata for this upload. This is a map of key-value pairs, where the key is the column name and the value
