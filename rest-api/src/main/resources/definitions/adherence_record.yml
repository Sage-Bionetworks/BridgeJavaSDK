type: object
description: A record describing the performance state of a scheduled session or assessment, as defined in a `Timeline`. Each record describes the state of a session or an assessment with a link back to that entry via an `instanceGuid`.
required:
    - instanceGuid
    - eventTimestamp
properties:
    instanceGuid:
        type: string
        description: The session or assessment instance GUID from the timeline that led to the generation of this record. There can be more than one record under a given instance GUID if that guid is for a persistent assessment, which can be performed more than once. In this case, each record must have a unique `startedOn` timestamp (time zone differences are not enough to make it unique, it must be a unique instant in time).
        x-nullable: false
    startedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: '2020-08-28T14:28:13.386Z'
        description: The client-supplied time when the activity was started (this time comes from the client and is not validated by the server). This value is normally set, but could be null if a participant declines a session or assessment.
    finishedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: '2020-08-28T14:28:13.386Z'
        description: The client-supplied time when the activity was recorded as finished (this time comes from the client and is not validated by the server). 
    eventTimestamp:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: '2020-08-28T14:28:13.386Z'
        description: The event timestamp (at the time of recording this record) that triggered the sequence of sessions and assessments which includes the scheduling item for this record. For mutable event IDs, this timestamp can change, and each time value groups a separate series of instance GUID records.
        x-nullable: false
    clientTimeZone:
        type: string
        description: An IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB) name for the participantâ€™s time zone at the time the record is submitted. If present, this field will be validated to be a valid time zone name.
        example: 'America/Los_Angeles'
    uploadedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: '2020-08-28T14:28:13.386Z'
        description: The timestamp when an uploaded was recorded as successfully uploaded. If this timestamp is missing, the upload has not yet reached the server.
    declined:
        type: boolean
        description: If the participant explicitly decides to skip a session or an assessment, this can be indicated by the mobile app by setting this flag to true. This can then used when considering adherence to the protocol.
        x-nullable: false
    clientData:
        type: object
        description: An arbitrary JSON structure that the client can use to record information about this schedule item (maximum size 65k).
    assessmentGuid:
        type: string
        description: The GUID of the assessment for this adherence record (as distinct from the `instanceGuid` for the instance of the performance of the assessment). Either this value or `sessionGuid` should be filled out for each record.
    sessionGuid:
        type: string
        description: The GUID of the session in which an assessment was performed for this adherence record (as distinct from the `instanceGuid` for the instance of the session). Either this value or `assessmentGuid` should be filled out for each record.
    type:
        type: string
        readOnly: true
