    If the app should issue a second reminder notification, when should this reminder be issued? If null, no reminder should be shown. If present, it can be relative to when a time window starts, or relative to when the window ends. This value works with `reminderPeriod` to determine the time.

    |---|---|
    |after_window_start|Issue the reminder `reminderPeriod` after the window starts|
    |before_window_end|Issue the reminder `reminderPeriod` before the window ends|
