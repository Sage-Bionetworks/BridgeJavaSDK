    Schedules come in three major flavors:

    |Type|Description|
    |---|---|
    |once|Activity happens once and only once, and then is never scheduled again.|
    |recurring|Activity recurrs periodically, either through the use of a cron schedule, or through the use of properties like `interval`, `times` and `expires`.|
    |persistent|Activity is always in the participant's list of tasks to do. If it is finished, a new activity is scheduled immediately. Client applications may wish to show these differently in the UI.|
enum:
    - once
    - recurring
