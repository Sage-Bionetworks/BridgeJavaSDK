    The roles assigned to this user. Only administrative accounts are assigned roles, which break down into two main categories: app-scoped permissions (developer, researcher) and study-scoped permissions conferred by organization membership (study coordinator, study designer). 

    |Role|Description|

    |study_designer|An individual tasked with modeling the portions of a scientific protocol in one or more studies (consents, studies, protocols, schedules), defined by the designer’s membership in an organization and the organization’s sponsorship of one or more studies.|
    |org_admin|An administrator who can manage an organization and the member accounts of that organization. The organization in turn grants access to the studies that are sponsored by the organization.|
