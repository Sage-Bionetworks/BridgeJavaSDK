    externalId:
        type: string
        description: |
            An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data 
            in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). 
            It is a string that can be set or updated to any value without constraints, unless Bridge is 
            configured to manage the study's external IDs. Then the ID must be submitted on sign up, and cannot be 
            modified afterward.
    id:

        readOnly: true
        description: An ID assigned to this account by Bridge system. This ID is exposed in the API and is

            along with the health code from Bridge.

            must be specified in the study's configuration, and the values are stored encrypted in case they 
            capture personally-identifying information).
