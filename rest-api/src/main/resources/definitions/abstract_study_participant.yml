    externalId:
        type: string
        description: |
            An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data 
            in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). 
            It is a string that can be set or updated to any value without constraints, unless Bridge is 
            configured to manage the study's external IDs. Then the ID must be submitted on sign up, and cannot be 
            modified afterward.
    id:
        type: string
        readOnly: true
        description: An ID assigned to this account by Bridge system. This ID is exposed in the API and is 
            different from the health code assigned to the user's anonymized data. Bridge never exports this ID 
            along with the health code from Bridge.

            A map of user profile attributes that have been set for this user (the attributes themselves 
            must be specified in the study's configuration, and the values are stored encrypted in case they 
            capture personally-identifying information).
