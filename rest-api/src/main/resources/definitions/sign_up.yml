    The information necessary to sign up for a Bridge app. **Only the app's ID, an email address, and a password are required to sign up for an app.** However, all the information of [AbstractStudyParticipant](#AbstractStudyParticipant) can be submitted at sign up. In some configurations of the server, for example, an `externalId` value must be submitted at the time of sign up.

                An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). The value can be set on creation or added on an account update, but it will be returned in the `externalIds` mapping which specifies the study within which the external ID was defined. This field will be null when retrieved from the server.
