    The information necessary to sign up for a Bridge study. **Only the study's ID, an email address, and a password
    are required to sign up for a study.** However, all the information of
    [AbstractStudyParticipant](#AbstractStudyParticipant) can be submitted at sign up. In some configurations of
    the server, for example, an `externalId` value must be submitted at the time of sign up.

                An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). It is a string that can be set or updated to any value without constraints, unless Bridge is configured to manage the study's external IDs. Then the ID must be submitted on sign up, and cannot be modified afterward.

                If sign ups for your study may include a consent to participate submitted prior to sign up,
                this field should be set to true to check for and finalize that consent. Otherwise this should be left false.
