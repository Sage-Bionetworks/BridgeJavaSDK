    Make a request to sign in through an email. This request will trigger the email to be sent 
    to an existing account's email address (no more than once per minute). When the user clicks 
    on this link, the installed app should be registered to intercept and handle the link. The 
    link will include a token that can be sent to the server to authenticate, along with an 
    optional password reset. (This feature must be enabled for your study.)
