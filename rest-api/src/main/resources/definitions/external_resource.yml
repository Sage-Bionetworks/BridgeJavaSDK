            The optimistic locking version of the assessment. This value must be submitted as part of the next update of the model. If it does not match the value on the server, a 409 error (Conflict) will prevent the update from occurring. It can also serve as a key to determine if a local cache of `Assessment` needs to be updated.

    upToDate:
        type: boolean
        readOnly: true
        description: The `createdAtRevision` field records the revision of the assessment when this resource link was created or last updated. If that value is equal to the most recent (highest) revision of the assessment, `upToDate` will be true. Otherwise it will be false. This can help flag resources that may no longer be relevant for the assessment.
