    A group of activities to be performed together in a study by a participant. The session can describe a repeating sequence that can repeat up to the length of a schedule.

    guid:
        type: string
        description: The unique identifier for this model.
        x-nullable: false
    name:
        type: string
        description: A required name for this session that will be shown to schedule authors, and can be used as a label for participants if no label can be found.
        x-nullable: false
    labels:
        type: array
        description: A collection of labels for this schedule. Only one label can be included for a given language. The system will first try and select the participant’s preferred languages (from most to least preferred), then it will select an English (“en”) language default message. If an English label does not exist in the list of labels, then the schedule name will be used as a label.

    startEventIds:
        type: array
        items:
            type: string
        description: One or more event IDs, either system defined or custom-defined for the study. If they are custom events, prepend them with the "custom:" string (this is not absolutely necessary, but if your custom event ID ever conflicts with a system ID, it will be interpreted as a system ID). If the event ID does not exist in the map of event to timestamp IDs for a participant, this session and the series of scheduled assessments to perform should be ignored. A session must declare at least one start event or study burst ID.
        x-nullable: false
    studyBurstIds:
        type: array
        items:
            type: string
        description: One ore\ more study bursts that can generate events that should trigger the scheduling of this session. If the study burst has not fired, then the events it creates will not exist, so they will not be in the map of event to timestamp IDs for a participant, and this session and and the series of scheduled assessments to perform should be ignored. A session must declare at least one start event or study burst ID.
    delay:
        type: string
        description: |
            A period of time after the start event timestamp before the session should be presented to the participant. Only minute, hour, day, and week values are allowed (although these can be mixed).
        format: ISO 8601 Duration
        example: P7D
    interval:
        type: string
        description: |
            After the start time of the first session (which is measured from an event timestamp plus the delay period), a period of time before the session should be presented to the participant again. Note that this interval is separate from the time window start and expiration. Only day and week values are allowed (although these can be mixed). The expiration period of a time window cannot be longer in duration than the interval of the session itself.
        format: ISO 8601 Duration
        example: P7D

        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: If the session has an interval, the user should perform the session until the end of the schedule’s duration, *unless* a smaller number of repetitions is specified via `occurrences`.

    assessments:
        type: array
        description: A collection of assessment references. When creating a schedule, default values from an assessment can be used to populate these reference objects, which can then be changed by the study designer. *Therefore if an assessment is changed, the values will not be updated in the schedule.*
