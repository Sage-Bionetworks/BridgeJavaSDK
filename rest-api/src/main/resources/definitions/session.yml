    A group of activities to be performed together in a study by a participant. The session can describe a repeating sequence that can repeat up to the length of a schedule.
type: object
required:
    - name
    - startEventId
    - performanceOrder
properties:
    guid:
        type: string
        description: The unique identifier for this model.
        x-nullable: false
    name:
        type: string
        description: A required name for this session that will be shown to schedule authors, and can be used as a label for participants if no label can be found.
        x-nullable: false
    labels:
        type: array
        description: A collection of labels for this schedule. Only one label can be included for a given language. The system will first try and select the participant’s preferred languages (from most to least preferred), then it will select an English (“en”) language default message. If an English label does not exist in the list of labels, then the schedule name will be used as a label.
        items:
            $ref: ./label.yml
        x-nullable: false
    startEventId:
        x-nullable: false
        description: An identifier for the event which should be used to schedule this sequence of sessions. The identifier may be mapped to a timestamp for a user. If the event ID does not exist for the user, the client should ignore this session and schedule nothing. If the event ID exists, the client should start with that timestamp and schedule forward in time according to the information in the session and its schedule.
    delay:
        type: string
        description: |
            A period of time after the start event timestamp before the session should be presented to the participant. Only minute, hour, day, and week values are allowed (although these can be mixed).
        format: ISO 8601 Duration
        example: P7D
    interval:
        type: string
        description: |
            After the start time of the first session (which is measured from an event timestamp plus the delay period), a period of time before the session should be presented to the participant again. Note that this interval is separate from the time window start and expiration. Only day and week values are allowed (although these can be mixed). The expiration period of a time window cannot be longer in duration than the interval of the session itself.
        format: ISO 8601 Duration
        example: P7D
    occurrences:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: If the session has an interval, the user should perform the session until the end of the schedule’s duration, *unless* a smaller number of repetitions is specified via `occurrences`.
    performanceOrder:
        $ref: ./enums/performance_order.yml
        x-nullable: false
    timeWindows:
        type: array
        description: A collection of time windows.
        items:
            $ref: ./time_window.yml
        x-nullable: false
    assessments:
        type: array
        description: A collection of assessment references. When creating a schedule, default values from an assessment can be used to populate these reference objects, which can then be changed by the study designer. *Therefore if an assessment is changed, the values will not be updated in the schedule.*
        items:
            $ref: ./assessment_reference2.yml
        x-nullable: false
    notifyAt:
        $ref: ./enums/notification_type.yml
        x-nullable: false
    remindAt:
        $ref: ./enums/reminder_type.yml
        x-nullable: false
        description: If a second notification (a reminder) should be show to the participant every time a time window starts, when relative to the window should it occur? This value works with `reminderPeriod` to determine the time. If null, no reminder should be shown.
    reminderPeriod:
        type: string
        description: |
            The time after a window starts or before it ends (based on the `remindAt` property) when a reminder should be issued to the client. Only minute, hour, day, and week values are allowed (although these can be mixed).
        format: ISO 8601 Duration
        example: PT10M
    allowSnooze:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            Allow the participant to “snooze” a notification or reminder (dismiss it with some amount of time before it occurs again). Cannot be true if `notifyAt` is null.
        default: false
    messages:
        type: array
        description: The message to use for a notification and reminder, if these have been specified. Whether these are enabled or not, notification messages will be validated. Only one message can be included for a given language. The system will first try and select the participant’s preferred languages (from most to least preferred), then it will select an English (“en”) language default message. An English language default message *must* be provided because there is no other reasonable fallback value.
