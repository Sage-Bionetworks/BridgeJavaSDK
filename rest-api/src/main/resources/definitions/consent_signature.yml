    To consent to participation in a subpopulation (also known as a consent group), participants submit their electronic signature. This can include an image of their actual signature. 

    At the time of consent, participants also submit a decision on how widely they will share their medical information with researchers (see the scope property of the ConsentSignature JSON object, below).

    How you describe to participants the choice to share research data is important if they are to correctly understand the consequences of this decision. We suggest that applications present the following language to users when making this choice:

    * **Option #1:** No data sharing. I do not agree to share my coded data (without my name) at this time;
    * **Option #2:** I agree to share my coded data (without my name) with researchers at the sponsor institution, and their partners, in order to conduct this study;
    * **Option #3:** I agree to share my coded data (without my name) with qualified researchers worldwide, for general health research.

    Note that if your study does re-identify participants in the study, this language will have to be adjusted.
