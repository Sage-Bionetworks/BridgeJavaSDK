    instanceGuids:
        type: array
        description: Session or assessment instance GUIDs. Any records that exist with these GUIDs will be returned (scoped to a specific participant in a specific study). If the assessment is a persistent assessment, all adherence records for that assessment will be returned unless includeRepeats is false. This array cannot contain more than 500 items.
        items:
            type: string
        x-nullable: false
    assessmentIds:
        type: array
        description: Return adherence records for assessments with these IDs (the assessment ID is used to define a type of assessment). This array cannot contain more than 500 items.

    sessionGuids:
        type: array
        description: Return adherence records for sessions with these GUIDs (this is the session’s GUID in a schedule and not an instance GUID, and is used to define a type of session). This array cannot contain more than 500 items.

    timeWindowGuids:
        type: array
        description: Return adherence records for assessments in these time windows (using the time window’s GUID in a schedule to define a type of time window). This array cannot contain more than 500 items.

    includeRepeats:
        type: boolean
        description: Where an assessment can be performed multiple times under an instance GUID, all records will be returned unless this flag is set to true. In this case, the first or last record only will be returned (depending on sort order).
    currentTimestampsOnly:
        type: boolean
        description: Where a time series can be performed multiple times because a session’s trigger event is mutable, all records will be returned, unless this flag is set to true. When true, only records with recent event timestamp values will be returned. This is equivalent to sending back the user’s entire map of current event ID timestamp values via the `eventTimestamps` map in this search object. If values are also provided in the `eventTimestamps` map, each of those event IDs will override its associated event ID timestamp value, as it is provided by setting this flag to true.
    eventTimestamps:
        type: object
        description: A mapping of event IDs to timestamp values to use when retrieving adherence records that are from sessions triggered by that ID. Only records with that exact timestamp value in their `eventTimestamp` field will be returned. In general, mobile clients will only want to retrieve records for current timestamp values when calculating schedules, so the `currentTimestampsOnly` flag provides an easy way to request that all current timestamps be used to limit search results. This map cannot contain more than 50 entries.
