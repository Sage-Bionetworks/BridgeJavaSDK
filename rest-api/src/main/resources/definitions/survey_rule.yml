    A constraint may have one or more rules in an array:
    * Rules should be evaluated after a user answers a question, against the answer provided by the user;
    * they should be evaluated until one matches (then further evaluation should be aborted);
    * if a rule matches, the action for that rule should be followed (e.g. showing a different question than the next question in the list, or ending the survey);
    * if a question allows multiple answers to be submitted, it matches the rule if any of the submitted answers match the rule;
    * if there are no rules or no rule matches, proceed to the next question in the list.

    Either `skipToTarget` or `endSurvey` should be supplied in the rule (but not both).

            The property will reference an identifier for a question in the survey. The user's next 
            question should be that question, and progress through the survey should proceed from 
            that question in the list. The target question should be after the current question in the 
            survey.
