    An information screen or question may have one or more rules in an array:
    * Rules should be evaluated after a user answers a question, against the answer provided by the user;
    * if a rule matches, the action for that rule should be followed (e.g. showing a different question than the next question in the list, or ending the survey);
    * that rule will specify whether or not further rules in the list should be evaluated (navigation rules 
    end evaluation, while other actions do not); 
    * if a question allows multiple answers to be submitted, the rule expression matches the rule if any 
    of the submitted answers match the rule;
    * if there are no rules or no rule matches, proceed to the next question in the list.
 
    One and only one action should be provided in the rule: `skipTo`, `endSurvey`, or `assignDataGroup`.

    - operator
    - value
properties:
    operator:
        $ref: ./enums/operator.yml
    value:
        type: string
        description: |
            The value against which the rule expression will be tested (always expressed as 
            a string, regardless of the question's data type). For example, a rule with value="10", 
            operator=eq, indicates that the survey rule expression will be true if the user's answer
            is equal to 10.
    skipTo:
        type: string
        description: |
            The property will reference an identifier for a question in the survey. If specified, and 
            the rule's expression is true, stop evaluating survey rules and display that question 
            next. Progress through the survey should proceed from that question in the list. The target 
            question should be after the current question in the survey.
    endSurvey:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            If specified, and the rule's expression is true, immediately stop evaluating rules and end 
            the survey. The users existing answers to the survey should be sent to the server.
    assignDataGroup:
        type: string
        description: |
            If specified, the value is a data group that should be added to the survey taker if the 
            rule expression is true, or removed if the rule expression is false. Survey rules 
            that specify `assignDataGroup` do not end evaluation of rules in the list; the engine 
            should proceed to evaluate and apply the next rule in the list.
