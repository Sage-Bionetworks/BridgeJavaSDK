    Note: For legacy reasons, this is the only model object returned from the API that does not have a type property reflecting the implementation structure of the JSON. Instead, the type attribute is of the type [UploadFieldType](#UploadFieldType).
type: object
required:
    - name
    - type
    - multiChoiceAnswerList
properties:
    name:
        type: string
        description: Field name. A schema cannot contain fields with the same name.
    required:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: Whether this field is required.
    type:
        $ref: ./enums/upload_field_type.yml
    allowOtherChoices:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            Used for MULTI_CHOICE. True if the multi-choice field allows an "other" answer with user freeform text. This tells BridgeEX to reserve an "other" column for this field. Can be null, so that the number of field parameters doesn't explode.
    fileExtension:
        type: string
        description: |
            Used for ATTACHMENT_V2 types. Used as a hint by BridgeEX to preserve the file extension as a quality-of-life improvement. Includes the period. Examples: ".json", ".csv". Optional, defaults to ".tmp".
    mimeType:
        type: string
        description: |
            Used for ATTACHMENT_V2 types. Used as a hint by BridgeEX to mark a Synapse file handle with the correct MIME type as a quality-of-life improvement. Optional, defaults to "application/octet-stream".
    maxLength:
        type: integer
        description: |
            Used for STRING, SINGLE_CHOICE, and INLINE_JSON_BLOB types. This is a hint for BridgeEX to create a Synapse column with the right width.

            If not specified, Bridge will use the default max length of 100 (if applicable).
    multiChoiceAnswerList:
        type: array
        description: |
            Used for MULTI_CHOICE types. This lists all valid answers for this field. It is used by BridgeEX to create the Synapse table columns for MULTI_CHOICE fields. This is a list because order matters, in terms of Synapse column order. Must be specified if the field type is a MULTI_CHOICE.

            For schemas generated from surveys, this list will be the "value" in the survey question option, or the "label" if value is not specified.
        items:
            type: string
    unboundedText:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            True if this field is a text-field with unbounded length. (Only applies to fields that are serialized as text, such as INLINE_JSON_BLOB, SINGLE_CHOICE, or STRING. Can be null, so that the number of field parameters doesn't explode. This flag takes precedence over the maxLength value.
