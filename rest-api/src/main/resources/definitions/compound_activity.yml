description: A pointer to a compound activity, which represents multiple schemas or survey's worth of tasks for a user
    to perform. The task ID is used to uniquely identify the compound activity, and the activity can contain one or
    more schemas or surveys. When creating a Schedule Plan, you should leave the schema and survey lists empty, and the
    scheduler will automatically resolve the compound activity from a compound activity definition, using the task ID
    as the key.
