    For historical reasons, a revision of a consent document is known as a "study consent" (it would more accurate to call it a "subpopulation consent"). It is a revision of the consent document that is associated with a subpopulation.

    Subpopulations can be used to group users for several purposes, but the most important use of subpopulations is to divide users into different *consent groups.* 

    **Note:** calls that return lists of these study consents do not populate the `documentContent` property. You must retrieve an individual study consent to get the content of the consent.
