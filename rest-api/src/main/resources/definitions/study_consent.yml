    For historical reasons, a revision of a consent document is known as a "study consent" (it would more accurate to call it a "subpopulation consent"). It is a revision of the consent document that is associated with a subpopulation.

    Subpopulations can be used to group users for several purposes, but the most important use of subpopulations is to divide users into different *consent groups.* 

    **Note:** calls that return lists of these study consents do not populate the `documentContent` property. You must retrieve an individual study consent to get the content of the consent.

            A valid XHTML document describing the consent. In this document, the following tokens can be inserted and they will be substituted with the user's consent information when the consent is requested for that user:

            |Template variable|Substituted with|
            |---|---|
            |${appName}|The name of the app|
            |${supportEmail}|The support email address for the app|
            |${technicalEmail}|The technical contact/support email address for the app|
            |${sponsorName}|The name of the sponsor for this app (the institution or research team name)|

            The signature block will be appended to the end of your consent document. **It is not possible to remove or change the signature block at this time.**
