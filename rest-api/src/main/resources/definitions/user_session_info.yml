                An externally-assignable identifier a research partner can use to re-identify a user's data in the exported data set (this must be provided by the application, it is not created by Bridge). It is a string that can be set or updated to any value without constraints, unless Bridge is configured to manage the study's external IDs. Then the ID must be submitted on sign up, and cannot be modified afterward.
