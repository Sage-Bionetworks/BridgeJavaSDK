        description: |
            A map of operating system names to minimum app versions. The user must send a `User-Agent` header
            in a prescribed format, that declares the app version to be equal to or less than this
            version number, in order to match.

    revision:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: |
            Revision number of the schema, used to distinguish versions of the same data format.
            This should be blank when creating a schema, and it should be passed back to the server 
            when updating. If the schema revision cannot be updated in a backwards-compatible fashion, 
            the server will throw an exception. You will need to increment the revision number 
            and create a new revision of the schema.
    schemaId:
        type: string
        description: Unique identifier for the schema.
    surveyGuid:
        type: string
        description: |
            If this schema is created from a survey, this is the GUID of the survey it represents.
    studyId:
        type: string
        description: |
            **Only available through worker APIs.** The identifier of the study from which this schema was retrieved.

        description: |
            If this schema is created from a survey, this is the createdOn timestamp 
            (in ISO 8601 format) of the survey it represents.

    version:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: |
            The optimistic locking version of the survey. This value must be submitted as 
            part of the next update of the model. If it does not match the value on the server, 
            a 409 error (Conflict) will prevent the update from occurring.
