type: object
required:
    - eventId
    - timestamp
properties:
    eventId:
        type: string
        description: A string identifying this event. The event ID must be in a specific format based on the type of event (e.g. `study_burst:foo:02` or `custom:event1`).
        x-nullable: false
    answerValue:
        type: string
        description: Answer value for a question event, or the iteration value for a study burst event.
        readOnly: true
    timestamp:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        example: '2020-08-28T14:28:13.386Z'
        description: ISO 8601 date and time that the event occurred. This timestamp may be generated by the server for system events, or it may be submitted by a client, in which case it will be according to the client’s clock which may be skewed from the server or actual time. The `createdOn` field can help to identify such clients.
        x-nullable: false
    updateType:
        $ref: ./enums/activity_event_update_type.yml
        x-nullable: false
        description: The update type is carried over to the specific event records for informational purposes.
    clientTimeZone:
        type: string
        example: 'America/Los_Angeles'
        description: An IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB) name for the participant’s time zone at the time the record is submitted. If present, this field will be validated to be a valid time zone name. If this event is an origin event for a study burst, the client time zone will be copied into the study burst events that are generated.
    originEventId:
        type: string
        description: If this event is generated from a study burst, the originating event ID that triggers the study burst to occur. Available for tools to order events in UIs.
    studyBurstId:
        type: string
        description: If the event is generated from a study burst, the identifier of the study burst (note that this is also part of the value of the event ID itself).
    periodFromOrigin:
        type: string
        description: If the event is generated from a study burst, An ISO 8601 duration, describing the period after the originating event’s timestamp when this event has been scheduled to occur. This value increments with each study burst event in the sequence by the interval value of the study burst itself.
    recordCount:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: The number of unique timestamp values that have been recorded for this event. This field is present in list views, but not when this individual event is retrieved from the server. Immutable events should only ever have one record, while mutable events (`future_only` and `mutable`) can have any number of historical values.
    createdOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
