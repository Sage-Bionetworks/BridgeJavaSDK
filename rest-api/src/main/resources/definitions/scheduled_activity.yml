    Description of an activity (such as a task or survey) the study would like the participant to perform. A scheduled activity will contain a reference to a task, a survey, a compound task (which can include any combination of tasks and surveys), and the activityType will reflect which property exists on the scheduled activity object (e.g. if a task is defined, the activityType will be "task"). 
type: object
required:
    - guid
properties:
    guid:
        type: string
    schedulePlanGuid:
        type: string
    startedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: This field is filled out by the client to persist the fact that a task has been started. Started on is always reported in UTC, regardless of the time zone being used to express the scheduling window (scheduledOn to expiresOn).
    finishedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: This field is filled out by the client to persist the fact that a task has been finished. To delete a task, record a finishedOn timestamp and leave the startedOn field blank. Finished on is always reported in UTC, regardless of the time zone being used to express the scheduling window (scheduledOn to expiresOn).
    scheduledOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: |
            The time at which the activity should be made available to the participant. It's fine to show the activity before this, but the user should not be able to start it until this time has passed. Time will be expressed in the time zone sent to the server to request the scheduled activities.
    expiresOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: |
            The time after which this task should no longer be made available to the participant. It will also no longer be returned from the server API. Time will be expressed in the time zone sent to the server to request the scheduled activities.
    activity:
        $ref: ./activity.yml 
    persistent:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            Is this activity persistent? If so, it will never be removed from the list of activities; the client may wish to provide different UI for such a task.
    clientData:
        type: object
        description: |
            An arbitrary object that will be serialized and stored as JSON using the GSON serialization mechanisms. In Java this field is an Object; since the type of the object is not known, the rest-client includes a utility method:
            ```
            MyCustomObject data = RestUtils.toType(
                activity.getClientData(), MyCustomObject.class);
            ```
    status:
        $ref: ./enums/schedule_status.yml
    type:
        type: string
        readOnly: true
