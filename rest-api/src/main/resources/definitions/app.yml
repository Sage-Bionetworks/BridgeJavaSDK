        x-nullable: false
    automaticCustomEvents:
        type: object
        description: |
            Custom events that should be generated for participant upon enrollment. The key in this map is the eventId, and the value is the offset after the enrollment event (eg, "P1D" for one day after enrollment, "P-2W" for 2 weeks before enrollment). Note that this API will automatically pre-pend "custom:" in front of the event key when generating the eventId (eg, eventId "studyBurstStart" becomes event ID "custom:studyBurstStart").
        additionalProperties:
            type: string
        x-nullable: false
    autoVerificationEmailSuppressed:
        description: |
            True if the automatic email verification email on sign-up should be suppressed. False if the email should be sent on sign-up. This is generally used in conjunction with email sign-in, where sending a separate email verification email would be redundant.
        type: boolean
        x-nullable: false
    consentNotificationEmailVerified:
        description: True if the consent notification email is verified. False if not.

    installLinks:
        type: object
        description: |
            This can be either to an app store (URLs mapped to the keys "iOS" or "Android"), or an intermediate web
            page that will route to a final app or appstore (URLs mapped to the key "Universal"). iOS and Android take
            precedence over the Universal URL.
        additionalProperties:

    uploadMetadataFieldDefinitions:
        type: array
        description: |
            Metadata fields can be configured for any app. This metadata will be implicitly added to every schema and automatically added to every Synapse table.

            All metadata field definitions are implicitly optional. The "required" field in metadata field definitions is ignored.

    identifier:
        type: string
        description: |
            A user selected identifier that is unique relative to all other Bridge studies (lower-case letters and dashes only). The identifier serves as a "domain" that scopes accounts to that app, and is usually created by combining an institution and app tag or acronym. For example, if you work at the University of Washington and your app is on Asthma in Children, your identifier might be `uw-child-asthma`. Participants will not see this identifier.
        x-nullable: false
    version:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: |
            A version number used for optimistic locking of the object these keys represent; this value must be passed back to the server on updates. If the version doesn't match the version in the database, an error will be returned (409 Conflict) and the app will not be saved. 
        x-nullable: false
    minAgeOfConsent:
        type: integer
        default: 18
        description: |

        x-nullable: false
    appIdExcludedInExport:
        description: |
            True if the Bridge Exporter should include the appId prefix in the "originalTable" field in the appVersion (now "Health Data Summary") table in Synapse. This is false for legacy studies for backwards compatibility, but is true for all new studies being created.

            This can only be changed by a Bridge admin. Care should be taken before changing this setting, as it may partition the data in Synapse.
        type: boolean
        x-nullable: false
    synapseDataAccessTeamId:
        type: integer
        format: int64

    synapseProjectId:
        type: string
        description: The Synapse project to export health data records to.
    usesCustomExportSchedule:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Note: Bridge engineers will normally set this value when setting up data export. You should probably leave this setting as is.** By default, all studies are exported using the default nightly schedule. Some studies may need custom schedules for hourly or on-demand exports. To prevent this app from being exported twice (once by the custom schedule, once by the default schedule), you should set this attribute to true.
        x-nullable: false
    userProfileAttributes:
        type: array
        description: |
            Custom attributes that can be added to the StudyParticipant object (as members of the attributes property). For example, if you wished to collect a telephone number for participants and had permission to do so, you could add the "telephone" attribute. The map of a user's profile attributes can be personally identifying health information; it will be stored encrypted and in a separate data store from the participant's health data.

            type: string
        x-nullable: false
    taskIdentifiers:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be used to identify tasks when creating schedules. These mostly serve to prevent typos when designing schedules, which would prevent client scheduling from working. There's no hard limit on the string content (e.g. "Tapping Test" is fine as a task identifier, as long as it uniquely identifies a task known to the application).
        items:
            type: string
        x-nullable: false
    dataGroups:
        type: array
        description: |
            An enumerated list of **unique** strings that can be assigned to user accounts. This is a list of the "tags" that can be assigned to a given user. The specific data groups that *are* assigned to a user will be exported with a participant's health data to Synapse. This can be used to identify test users or specific cohorts in the app, but it should not include sensitive health information about participants. Strings must contain only letters, numbers, underscore or dash, and cannot (as a comma-separated list) exceed the character limit of 100 characters so they can be exported to Synapse.
        items:
            type: string
        x-nullable: false
    passwordPolicy:
        description: |
            Settings that will govern what is accepted as a valid password when users sign up for the app. If not included, the password policy will default to requiring 8 characters, including lower and upper-case letters, at least one number and at least one symbol.

    emailVerificationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** Should users be asked to validate that they control the email addresses they use to sign up for the app? True by default.  (Using an email address to send a 
            sign in link will also verify it.)
        x-nullable: false
    autoVerificationPhoneSuppressed:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** Should the system send a confirmation SMS message on sign 
            up if phone verification is enabled?
        x-nullable: false
    emailSignInEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** If enabled, the user will be able to trigger an email with an URL that can be used to sign into the server, in lieu of a normal sign in process.
        x-nullable: false
    phoneSignInEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** If enabled, the user will be able to trigger an SMS message which contains a token that can be used to sign in to the server, in lieu of a normal sign in process.
        x-nullable: false
    reauthenticationEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** Enable or disable the ability to issue a reauthentication token in a session, and call the reauthentication APIs to issue a new session. 
        x-nullable: false
    externalIdRequiredOnSignup:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** Should the external ID be required on sign up? If this is true and external ID validation is enabled, this app can support lab codes (where the username and password are auto-generated from the external ID and the user only needs to enter a code).
        x-nullable: false
    verifyChannelOnSignInEnabled:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
            **Can only be changed by an administrator.** Should the the credential that is submitted during sign-in 
            be verified? This is always true (with the exception of legacy studies) and should not be changed.
        x-nullable: false
    accountLimit:
        type: integer
        default: 0
        description: |
            **Can only be set by an administrator.** If not zero, sets an upper-bound limit on the number of accounts that can be created for this app. Once this number is reached, no more sign ups or user creation can occur.
        x-nullable: false
    disableExport:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            If set this field to true, Bridge Exporter will not export this app at all during exporting.
        x-nullable: false
    minSupportedAppVersions:
        type: object
        description: |
            Minimum supported app versions (older versions will be blocked), keyed by the name of the operating system (we expect either "Android" or "iPhone OS" in the User-Agent header of all requests sent to the server). Example: `{"iPhone OS":14,"Android":10}`

        type: object
        description: |
            A map between operating system names, and the platform ARN necessary to register a device to receive mobile push notifications. The operating system names are currently "Android" and "iPhone OS". The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is the name of the Application/platform ARN defined in SNS (currently this must be done by a Bridge administrator).
