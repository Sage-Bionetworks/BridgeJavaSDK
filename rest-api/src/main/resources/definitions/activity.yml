    When creating an activity as part of a Schedule, you will need to supply a SurveyReference or a TaskReference in the activity. When these are returned, any survey reference that points to the "most recently published" survey will be resolved to a specific survey revision (the one most recently published).

    Scheduled activities may be requested into the future by the client, and then cached. So if a survey is changed and published, it may be a few days before participants receive the updated survey.
