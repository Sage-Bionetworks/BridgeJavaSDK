    A subpopulation in the Bridge server is a group of people who, for the purposes of the study, must agree to a specific 
    consent in order to participate in a study. (Some consents can be optional; these will not prevent participants from 
    using Bridge.) For example, a study may have one consent for all participants and a further, optional consent to 
    contribute genetic information. The user must sign the first consent, and may choose to sign the second consent; 
    Bridge will track the status of all this and refuse data from a participant who has not signed all required consents.

    * Users are assigned to one or more subpopulations on every request;
    * Bridge verifies that the user has signed all their required consents;
    * If they have, they are given access to the system. Their session will include detailed information about their consent status;
    * If the user's consent is not complete, Bridge returns a 412 response (Precondition Not Met). The JSON in that response will 
        include a [UserSessionInfo](#UserSessionInfo) object that contains a summary of the user's consent status.

    **Note:** filtering on Bridge is **opt-in**: if a request does not include information like a `User-Agent` 
    header, then all subpopulations may be assumed to apply to the caller.

    guid:
        type: string
        description: |
            A unique auto-generated identifier for the subpopulation. Usually a GUID (but not always). Cannot be 
            changed after creation. Used to retrieve the published consent for this subpopulation.
    name:
        type: string
        description: The name of this subpopulation.

        type: string
        description: The description of this subpopulation.
    criteria:
        $ref: ./criteria.yml
        description: |
            Optional selection criteria that can be used to determine if a user should be assigned to this 
            subpopulation or not. If the user does not match a subpopulation, then that subpopulation and its 
            requirements are invisible to that user. Otherwise the user is in the subpopulation and all its 
            consent requirements apply.
    required:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            If true, participants must sign the consent associated with this subpopulation if they are identified 
            as a member of this subpopulation. Users will receive a 412 response from Bridge if this condition is 
            not met.
    defaultGroup:
        type: boolean
        description: |
            If true, this is the default subpopulation created for a study, and it cannot be deleted (although it can be changed, 
            and even made optional or hidden through the use of criteria).
    publishedConsentCreatedOn:
        type: string
        format: date-time
        description: |
            The creation date (ISO 8601 timestamp) of the version of the consent agreement for this subpopulation that is 
            published, ie. that is presented to users for their signature. The subpopulation guid and this createdOn 
            timestamp can be used to retrieve the consent document.
    version:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: | 
            The optimistic locking version of the survey. This value must be submitted as 
            part of the next update of the model. If it does not match the value on the server, 
            a 409 error (Conflict) will prevent the update from occurring.
    consentHTML:
        type: string
        description: |
            The URL to retrieve an HTML version of the published and active version of the consent. This can be 
            referenced in your mobile app, web site, etc. Publishing a new consent revision will update this document.
    consentPDF:
        type: string
        description: |
            The URL to retrieve a PDF version of the published and active version of the consent. This can be 
            referenced in your mobile app, web site, etc. Publishing a new consent revision will update this document.
