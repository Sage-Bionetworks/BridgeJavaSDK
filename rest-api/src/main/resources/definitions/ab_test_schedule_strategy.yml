    A strategy that divides users into groups according to a percentage scheme, assigning each 
    group a different [Schedule](/#Schedule). The combined set of schedule groups should have 
    percentages that add up to 100%. After the initial assignment, new users joining the study 
    will be randomly assigned to one of the groups in proportion to their percentage 
    representation in the study. 

    Note that this assignment is truly random, so in small populations the percentages may diverge 
    from those specified in the schedule plan.
