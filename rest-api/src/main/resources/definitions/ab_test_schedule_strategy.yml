    A strategy that divides users into groups according to a percentage scheme, assigning each group a different [Schedule](/#Schedule). The combined set of schedule groups should have percentages that add up to 100%. After the initial assignment, new users joining the study will be randomly assigned to one of the groups in proportion to their percentage representation in the study. 

    Note that this assignment is truly random, so in small populations the percentages may diverge from those specified in the schedule plan.
