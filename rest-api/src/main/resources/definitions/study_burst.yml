    The description of a repeating burst of events, against which a study can schedule repeating sets of activities. A study burst is triggered by an `originEventId`, it then occurs at an `interval` period of time after that event for a specific number of `occurrences`. For example, a study burst of "foo" that is triggered by the `timeline_retrieved` event, with an interval of "P1W" and an occurrence of 3 would generate three events: `study_burst:foo:01` (a week after the `timeline_retrieved` event), `study_burst:foo:02` (two weeks after `timeline_retrieved` event), and `study_burst:foo:03` (three weeks after the `timeline_retrieved` event).
