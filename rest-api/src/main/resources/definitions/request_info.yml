    Some basic information is captured when a participant makes a request to the Bridge server, 
    mostly for the purpose of troubleshooting user issues with the application or the study. 
    Questions that can be answered include:

    * what version of the app is this participant using?
    * what filtering criteria might be applied to their requests?
    * when was the last time they uploaded data or retrieved activities?
    * do they have a session right now, or have they contacted the server recently at all?

    This information is cached but not persisted; it is not guaranteed to be present for all active users.
