            Errors broken down by the part of the JSON payload that generated them. The keys are "paths" representing fragments of the JSON (expressed in JavaScript object/array notation), and the values are string arrays of one or more errors for that element of the JSON. An example makes this clearer:

            ```json
            "errors":{  
                "identifier":[  
                    "identifier is required"
                ],
                "elements[0].identifier":[  
                    "elements[0].identifier is required"
                ],
                "elements[0].constraints.enumeration":[  
                    "enumeration must have non-null, non-empty choices list"
                ],
                "elements[0].prompt":[  
                    "elements[0].prompt is required"
                ]
            }
            ```
