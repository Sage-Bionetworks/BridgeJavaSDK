            also a process that detects uploads to S3 and marks the uploads complete. This field indicates which client
            completed the upload.

            Calendar date the file was uploaded (specifically, the uploadComplete() call.
            Date is determined using Pacific local time. Pacific local time was chosen because currently, the vast
            majority of apps are done in the US, so if we partitioned based on date using UTC, we'd get a cut-off in
            the middle of the afternoon, likely in the middle of peak uploads. In the future, if we have apps outside
            of the US, the upload date timezone will be configurable per app.
