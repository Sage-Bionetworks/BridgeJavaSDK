    The ParticipantSchedule is similar to the Timeline in structure, but includes the specific dates when this participant should perform each session, based on this participant’s events. Entries in the `schedule` are ordered by `startDate` and `startTime`, and entries that are not available to the participant are not included in the schedule. However, definitions for those sessions are still included in the `sessions`, `assessments`, and `studyBursts` collections for future reference. The schedule is calculated based on the participant’s `clientTimeZone` value which is saved as part of their account record.
