        Gets all activities in a given date range (from inclusive start time to excluded end time), 
        including expired, available, finished, started, or scheduled activities for a user. The 
        activities are in the time range if their active window (from scheduled time to expiration 
        time) falls within the date range. The only activities that are not returned are deleted 
        activities (activities with a finishedOn timestamp but no startedOn timestamp). Scheduled 
        times are returned in the timezone of the timestamps (the timezone must be the same for 
        startTime and endTime). The date range cannot exceed 15 days.
