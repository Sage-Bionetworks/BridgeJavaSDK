        Get all scheduled activities in a given date range (from inclusive `startTime` to excluded `endTime`, must be less than 32 days), in one or more pages of results. An activity is included in the results if its scheduling window (`scheduledOn` to `expiresOn`) overlaps with the time range indicated by the request. The `startedOn` and `finishedOn` timestamps, if they exist for an activity, have no impact on whether it is included in this search query with the exception of deleted activities. These will not be returned in this query, and they are indicated by setting a `finishedOn` timestamp but no `startedOn` timestamp. **Persistent** activities will only ever return the current, active instance of that activity (you cannot retrieve the sequence of finished persistent activity instances, because this sequence is unbounded).
