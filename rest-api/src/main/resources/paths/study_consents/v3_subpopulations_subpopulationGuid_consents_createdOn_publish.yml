    summary: Publish a specific consent revision
    description: |
        Publish a specific revision of this subpopulation consent by its creation timestamp. This version of 
        the consent will be presented to users in order to participate in this subpopulation. If users have 
        signed any other revision of this consent, the `signedMostRecentConsent` flag in the consent status 
        record for this consent (in the user's session) will be false. However, the user is still considered to 
        be consented and will not be shut out of performing operations with a 412 response.
