    summary: Get all of the organizations in an app
    description: |
        Return all the organizations that have been defined for the app context of the caller. For most roles this will only return the callerâ€™s organization, but admins can view all organizations. These organization objects only contain the name and identifier of the organization (for the full record, call `getOrganization()`).
