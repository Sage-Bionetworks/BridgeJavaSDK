    operationId: deleteStudy
    summary: Delete a study. Developers and study designers can logically or physically delete a study if it is in the “legacy,” “design,” “completed,” or “withdrawn” phases. Admins can logically or physically delete a study at any lifecycle phase. All study participants are unassociated with the study (not withdrawn), so this should only be done on a study that has not yet been used, or that is completed with no further need to identify study participants.
