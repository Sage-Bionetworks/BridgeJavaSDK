    summary: Get the callerâ€™s timeline of scheduled assessments in this study. Timelines rarely change and can be large, though they are sent compressed by the server. This method also supports long-term caching through both the `If-Modified-Since` (timestamp) and `If-None-Match` (etag) HTTP request headers.
