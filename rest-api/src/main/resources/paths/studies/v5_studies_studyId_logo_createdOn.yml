        Create a new logo revision. The record returned contains the `uploadURL` field, where the logo must be PUT using an HTTP library with the following two headers:

        - **Content-Type** The mime type of the resource that was posted to this endpoint;
        - **Content-Disposition** A content disposition header with the value of `inline`.

        This upload URL expires in 10 minutes. When this upload has been completed, the client should then call the `finishLogoUpload` API (these steps are also encapsulated in the `RestUtils.uploadStudyLogoToS3` method).
