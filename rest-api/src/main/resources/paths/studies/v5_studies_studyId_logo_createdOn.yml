        After calling `createStudyLogo`, and uploading the logo to S3, a client must call this method to confirm that the file has been uploaded. An URL to the logo to download it will not be available in the studyâ€™s `studyLogoUrl` field until this method is called (the server does not validate that the file has in fact been uploaded to S3).
