        This API will not normally be called directly by a client. A user will receive an email 
        triggered by the /requestResetPassword call, with an URL to open up a password reset page 
        on the Bridge server. That page submits the new password along with a one-time session 
        token ("sptoken") to this endpoint, in order to change the password. The template for the 
        email that is sent can be configured as part of a Study through the management APIs. If 
        the token is not provided or is expired, this request will fail. If the user account does not 
        exist, this method will still return 200 in order to prevent "account enumeration" security 
        breaches.
