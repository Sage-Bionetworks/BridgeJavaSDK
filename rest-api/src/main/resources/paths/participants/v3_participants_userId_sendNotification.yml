    summary: Send a push notification to a single participant
    description: |
        Send a push notification to an individual participant (assuming they have registered for push notifications). 
        Do not use this method to notify a group of participants; create a topic, ask your users to subscribe to that 
        topic, and send a message via that topic instead.
