    summary: Delete all activities for a participant
    description: |
        Intended for use in development. Developers may wish to delete an account's scheduled activities in order 
        to see the impact of changes to schedules for a study. Otherwise, activities from the original 
        scheduling will persist until they expire, alongside tasks issued for the newly changed schedule. **This 
        should not be called on production accounts.**
