    summary: Get a study participant's upload history
    description: |
        Retrieve information about the uploads from a user. This is particularly useful during 
        development to verify the mobile application is sending valid data back to the Bridge 
        server. The API can retrieve any number of days worth of upload records, defined by the 
        startTime and endTime timestamps (ISO 8601 format), and paginated using a pageSize and 
        offsetKey value (null for the first page, but returned with subsequent requests to 
        retrieve further pages in the time range). If the endTime is not provided, it will 
        be one day after the startTime. If the startTime is not provided, it will be one day 
        before the endTime.
