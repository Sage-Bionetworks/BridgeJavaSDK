    summary: Add a participant report record
    description: |
        Endpoint for a worker to add a report record for a participant. Unlike other endpoints, 
        the worker must provide the healthCode of the target user (this endpoint allows external 
        processes working with data from Synapse to write reports back to Bridge).

    summary: Delete a participant report index
    description: |
        Delete a participant report index. These indices can be shared between users so they 
        are not normally deleted, but this endpoint allows the index identifiers to be deleted 
        during testing.
