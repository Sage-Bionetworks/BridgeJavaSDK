    operationId: updateUsersParticipantRecord
    summary: Update user's participant record
    description: |
        Update the current user's participant record. **Unlike most other calls in this API, you can send 
        partically complete JSON to this endpoint,** and it will selectively update the participant's record 
        (rather than treating missing properties as an instruction to delete those fields in the record). 
        This means that many existing APIs that sent a single update value, can direct those payloads to 
        this endpoint and they will still work fine. For this reason most `/v3/users/*` endpoints are 
        now deprecated, though there is no plan to remove them. Any authenticated user may call this 
        endpoint. **The user does not need to have consented to the study in order to update their participant 
        record.**
