    summary: Notify Bridge an upload is complete
    description: |
        Notify Bridge an upload is complete. Either a consented user or a worker 
        process can access this endpoint, but failure to have the worker role will 
        be treated like a consent error.
        
        If the upload metadata includes instanceGuid, eventTimestamp, and startedOn values matching an existing
        adherence record in the participant's schedule, then the adherence record will be updated to include
        this upload's identifier and uploadedOn date. If the adherence record does not exist then it will be
        created.

        In synchronous mode, this API will poll until upload validation is complete (or failed or is otherwise in a
        non-transient state), and return the upload validation status. In asynchronous mode, this API will return
        immediately and will also return the upload validation status, which is likely to be in
        "validation_in_progress".

              True if this API call should allow completing uploads that are already complete. This is to allow
              redrives and backfills.
