        Create a new file resource revision. The record returned contains the `uploadURL` field, where the resource must be PUT using an HTTP library with the following two headers:

        - **Content-Type** The mime type of the resource that was posted to this endpoint;
        - **Content-Disposition** A content disposition header with the value of `attachment; filename="name"` where the name is the name included in the revision object posted to this endpoint.

        This upload URL expires in 10 minutes. When this upload has been completed, the client should then call the `finishFileRevision` API (these steps are also encapsulated in the `RestUtils.uploadHostedFileToS3` method).
