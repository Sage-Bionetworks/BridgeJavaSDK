        Indicate to the server that a file revision upload has been completed. If this call is made and the S3 file is found, the revision record is moved from the `pending` to the `available` state (and the upload URL is removed from the record). If the S3 record is *not* on the server, then this call will return a 404 and the `FileRevision` record will be deleted.
