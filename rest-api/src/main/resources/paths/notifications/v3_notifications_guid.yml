    operationId: updateNotificationRegistration
    summary: Update a push notification registration
    description: |
        Update an existing device registration with a new token that has been assigned by the 
        client operating system. At least on iOS, the device token can change over the lifetime of 
        the app, and it is considered best practice to re-send this token to the server on every 
        start-up of the app. The guid returned from an update will always match the GUID that was 
        submitted.
