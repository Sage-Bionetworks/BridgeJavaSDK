        Return all the registrations for this user. There may be more than one if the user installs 
        the application on different devices. Bridge attempts to prevent multiple registrations on the
        save device.

    operationId: createNotificationRegistration
    summary: Register a client to receive push notifications
    description: |
        Create a new registration. The client will retrieve an identifying token (the exact format and 
        name for the token varies by platform), and register it with Bridge. Bridge will return a 
        Bridge-specific GUID to track this registration, which the client can use to update or delete 
        the registration at a later time. If the token already exists in an existing registration record, 
        then that registration record will be returned in lieu of creating a redundant record.
