    For historical reasons, a revision of a consent document is known as a "study consent" (it would more accurate to call it 
    a "subpopulation consent"). It is a revision of the consent document that is associated with a subpopulation.

    Subpopulations can be used to group users for several purposes, but the most important use of subpopulations is to divide 
    users into different *consent groups.* 

    **Note:** calls that return lists of these study consents do not populate the `documentContent` property. You must retrieve an 
    individual study consent to get the content of the consent.
required:
    - subpopulationGuid
    - createdOn
    - documentContent
properties:
    subpopulationGuid:
        type: string

            The time the document was created on the server. Each update of the consent document creates a new revision 
            at a new `createdOn` timestamp.
    documentContent:
        type: string
        description: |
            A valid XHTML document describing the consent. In this document, the following tokens can be inserted and they 
            will be substituted with the user's consent information when the consent is requested for that user:

            |Template variable|Substituted with|
            |---|---|
            |${studyName}|The name of the study|
            |${supportEmail}|The support email address for the study|
            |${technicalEmail}|The technical contact/support email address for the study|
            |${sponsorName}|The name of the sponsor for this study (the institution or research team name)|

            The signature block will be appended to the end of your consent document. **It is not possible to remove or 
            change the signature block at this time.**
