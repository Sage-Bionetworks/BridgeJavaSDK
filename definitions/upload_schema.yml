            Revision number of the schema, used to distinguish versions of the same data format.
            This should be blank when creating a schema, and it should be passed back to the server 
            when updating. If the schema revision cannot be updated in a backwards-compatible fashion, 
            the server will throw an exception. You will need to increment the revision number 
            and create a new revision of the schema.

            The optimistic locking version of the survey. This value must be submitted as 
            part of the next update of the model. If it does not match the value on the server, 
            a 409 error (Conflict) will prevent the update from occurring.
